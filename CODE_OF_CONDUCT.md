# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be the person your dog thinks you are.

## Guidelines

1. **Be kind.** Treat others with respect and empathy.

2. **No personal attacks.** Disagree with ideas, not people. Keep feedback constructive.

3. **Make software you want to use.** We're here to build something useful. Focus on that.

4. **Help others succeed.** Answer questions patiently. Remember you were new once too.

## That's It

This isn't a legal document. It's a reminder that there are humans on the other side of every issue, PR, and comment.

If someone's behavior is making it hard for others to participate, maintainers will address it. Repeated issues may result in being asked to leave.
